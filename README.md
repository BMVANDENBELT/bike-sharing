# bike-sharing
---------------------
# OVERVIEW
- The purpose of this analysis is to show investors data on bikesharing usage for New York City so they can decide if opening the same bike-sharing program in Des Moines is worth their investment. We used Tableau Public to build a storyboard that contains 7 visualizations for NYC Citi Bike

# SUMMARY

- If you look at all the viualizations above, we can see that:
  - Most of the bikes were checked out for roughly an hour or less
  - A lot of the checkouts were done by males
  - On the weekdays, the bikeshare hours were most popular during the daylight hours
  - Most of the usage is done by subscribers instead of customers
  - For usage type, subscribers hold the majority
  - The top starting locations can be found on the island
 - If we were to further the analysis, we could look at ages of the users and compare that to the average ages and gender of users in Des Moines. It would also be important to note the population of both cities. It's harder to drive in the big city as opposed to that of Des Moines.
